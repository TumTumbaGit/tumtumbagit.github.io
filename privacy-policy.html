      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        Effective date: <strong>August 15, 2025</strong><br/>
        Developer: <strong>NiceToPlay</strong>
      </p>
      <div class="card small">
        This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our mobile games built with Unreal Engine 5 and published on Google Play. 
        By using our apps, you agree to this Policy.
      </div>
    </main>

  <main>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or email) unless you voluntarily provide it when contacting us. Our apps and integrated services may automatically process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID/AAID), app instance IDs.</li>
      <li>Usage data (session duration, screens viewed, basic interaction events).</li>
      <li>Crash and performance data to help us fix bugs and improve stability.</li>
      <li>Advertising data (impressions, clicks, reward completion for rewarded ads).</li>
      <li>Purchase information related to Google Play Billing (product ID, purchase state, no payment card data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to show banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads. AdMob may collect and process data to provide, measure, and improve ads, including for personalization where allowed by law and your device settings.</p>
    <p>Learn more in Google’s policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Google uses information for ads</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      You can opt out of personalized advertising via your device settings:
      Android → Settings → Google → Ads → “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (wording may vary by version).
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Our games may offer premium features, cosmetic items (skins), and ad removal via Google Play Billing. Transactions are processed by Google; we do not receive or store your payment card details. We may store non-personal purchase metadata (e.g., product ID, entitlement state) to grant content you own.</p>

    <h2>4. Legal Bases & Purposes of Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: app security, fraud prevention, crash analytics, non-personal usage analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent (where required)</strong>: personalized ads and analytics features that require consent under local laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract/performance</strong>: delivering purchased content and core app features.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance</strong>: fulfilling legal obligations (e.g., tax and accounting records for purchases).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our apps are not directed to children under the age where consent is required by local law (e.g., under 13 in the U.S.). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child provided personal data, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share non-personal data with service providers solely to operate and improve the apps, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – advertising delivery and measurement.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play</strong> – purchase processing and entitlement management.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash/analytics services</strong> (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics, if used).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These partners process data under their own privacy policies and only as necessary to provide their services.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes described above, or as required by law (for example, purchase records for accounting). Aggregated, non-identifiable data may be retained longer for analytics.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable personalized ads in device settings (see Section 2).</li>
      <li>Limit permissions requested by the app via your OS settings.</li>
      <li>Uninstall the app to stop data collection by the app.</li>
      <li>Contact us to access or delete data you provided directly (e.g., email inquiries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Our service providers may process data on servers located outside your country. Where required, appropriate safeguards are used (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>11. Links to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>Our apps may link to external sites or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies, not this one.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the latest version in the app and/or on our website. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated Policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests regarding this Policy, contact us:</p>

      Notes for stores and reviewers: this app is built with Unreal Engine 5 and integrates Google AdMob for ads and Google Play Billing for in-app purchases (premium, cosmetic skins, ad removal, and rewarded ads where applicable).
